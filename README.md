## Project Overview

### Objectives
The goal of this project is to analyze customer support tickets to:
- Identify the most frequently reported issues.
- Understand response and resolution time performance.
- Recommend process improvements to enhance customer service efficiency and satisfaction.

### Tools Used
- Excel â€“ For manual inspection and summary statistics.
- Python (Pandas, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ For data cleaning, analysis, text mining and ploting.

### Dataset Description
The dataset consists of over 8,000 customer support tickets with the following key fields:
- Ticket Subject and Description â€“ Describe the customerâ€™s problem.
- Ticket Type, Priority, Channel, Status â€“ Metadata about the ticket.
- First Response Time, Time to Resolution, Created/Resolved Date â€“ Used to calculate delays.
- Customer Satisfaction Rating â€“ To gauge service quality.

### Key Analyses
- Text Analysis of Issues
- Time Delay Metrics
- Trend Spotting & Performance Bottlenecks
  
### Recommendations
- Implement auto-response systems to improve first response time.
- Offer guided solutions (e.g., FAQ links, troubleshooting wizards) for frequent issues.
- Monitor high-delay categories and consider workflow optimization or staff training.
- Use ticket triaging to handle priority cases more efficiently.
